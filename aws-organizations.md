## AWS Organization
AWS organizations is an account management service that enables you to consolidate multiple AWS accounts into an org that you create and centrally manage

### Consolidated Billing
- takes into account usage in aggregate across all OU (organizational units)
- one bill per AWS account
- very easy to track charges
- volume price discount

### Best practices
- always enable MFS on root account
- always use a strong and complex password
- paying account should be used for billing purposes only -- do not deploy resources into the paying account
- enable/disable aws services using Service Control Policies (SCP) either on an organizational unit (OU) or on individual accounts
